## About the project
FakesUsers -- is a project designed to generate random information from its database. It can be used for any purpose, as well as modified and improved in some way. filcher2011 is working on the project. He works hard on the project and tries to release updates more often.

## Import
In order to import the library, you need to install it :)

pip install FakesUsers
```
After that, in your file with the .py extension, write . . .

```

## Basic Concept
What commands are there in this library? This library has commands such as:
Changing the region for generation
```sh
genRegion('ru/en')
```
PS:If you put genRegion('ru'), then all names, numbers and addresses will be regenerated relevant for Russia. Well, if you put genRegion('en'), then all names, phone numbers and addresses will be regenerated relevant for the USA (default is 'ru')

Displaying a random name
```sh
fake_name('gender')
```
PS:If you write 'male' in brackets, then only male names will be generated, the opposite if you put 'female' in brackets

Displaying a random phone number
```sh
fake_number()
```

Displaying a random addres
```sh
fake_addres(True/False)
```
PS:True means that the address will be generated along with the city. Opposite with False

Displaying a random email
```sh
fake_email()
```

Displaying a random password
```sh
fake_pass()
```

Displaying a random city
```sh
fake_city()
```

Displaying a random Cart's number
```sh
fake_banknumber()
```

Displaying a random date of birth
```sh
fake_dob()
```

And displaying a random login
```sh
fake_login()
```

## Example Code
Let's look at a simple code that will output a random man's and woman's name, phone number and address
Code
```sh
from FakesUsers import Fu

fu = Fu()
fu.genRegion('en')

print(fu.fake_name('male'))
print(fu.fake_name('female'))
print(fu.fake_number())
print(fu.fake_addres(True))
print(fu.fake_addres(False))
print(fu.fake_dob())
print(fu.fake_email())
print(fu.fake_pass())
print(fu.fake_login())
print(fu.fake_banknumber())
print(fu.fake_number())
print(fu.fake_city())
```
