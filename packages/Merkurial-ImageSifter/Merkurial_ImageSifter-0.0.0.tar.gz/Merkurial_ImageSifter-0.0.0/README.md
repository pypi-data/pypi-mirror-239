# Overview
ImageSifter Is Used When You Want To Change The Directories Of Images..
Basically, It's A TK GUI For Going Through Images And Re-Categorizing Them Based On What You See. It Was Built In Tandem
With My ImageDownloader And ImageCategorizer For Helping With Categorizing More Accurately. It Only Requires Clicking,
Buttons Are Generated For You Based On The Directories It Is In After The Root Directory. Each Can Be Updated
Individually And The meta.json Data Is Also Updated To Fit Its New Location
