# PathIntegrate
PathIntegrate Python package for pathway-based multi-omics data integration

#### Abstract
>As terabytes of multi-omics data are being generated, there is an ever-increasing need for methods facilitating the integration and interpretation of such data. Current multi-omics integration methods typically output lists, clusters, or subnetworks of molecules related to an outcome. Even with expert domain knowledge, discerning the biological processes involved is a time-consuming activity. Here we propose PathIntegrate, a method for integrating multi-omics datasets based on pathways, designed to exploit knowledge of biological systems and thus provide interpretable models for such studies. PathIntegrate employs single-sample pathway analysis to transform multi-omics datasets from the molecular to the pathway-level, and applies a predictive single-view or multi-view model to integrate the data. Model outputs include multi-omics pathways ranked by their contribution to the outcome prediction, the contribution of each omics layer, and the importance of each molecule in a pathway. 

## Features
- Pathway-based multi-omics data integration using PathIntegrate Multi-View and Single-View models
    - Multi-View model: Integrates multiple omics datasets using a shared pathway-based latent space
    - Single-View model: Integrates multi-omics data into one set of multi-omics pathway scores and applies an SKlearn-compatible predictive model
    - Pathway importance
    - Sample prediction
- SKlearn-like API for easy integration into existing pipelines
- Support for multiple pathway databases, including KEGG and Reactome
- Support for multiple pathway scoring methods available via the [sspa](https://github.com/cwieder/py-ssPA) package
- Cytoscape Network Viewer app for visualizing pathway-based multi-omics data integration results
