The C++ code performing the generalized Louvain optimization is based on the 
implementation of the Louvain method as available from 
http://sites.google.com/site/findcommunities/ 
(Authors: Jean-Loup Guillaume / Etienne Lefebvre)

The Louvain code was adapted and extended by R. Lambiotte 
(http://www.lambiotte.be) to allow for the optimization of the stability quality 
function and was subsequently refined further by Antoine Delmotte. 

The MATLAB frontend was initally added by Antoine Delmotte. 
Later adjustments and additions, testing, and maintenance are due to 
Antoine Delmotte and Michael Schaub.

1.9.2012 - Version 1.0: 
Release of the first public version of the stability MATLAB toolbox (apd, mts)
28.9.2012 
Removed unused small code segment in Normalised/community.cpp that could lead to 
compilation errors in Windows (mts, apd)
19.10.2012
Added some header files that can be required for some Linux systems (mts, apd)

=======
25.6.2013 - Version 2.0
New version of matlab interface including ability to treat directed graph (mts)

29.12.2013
-Added some header files that can be required for some Linux systems.
-Added some header files that can be required for Mac Users (Thanks to Adrien Fallou (afallou)).

22.6.2015
-bugfixes for check of isolated nodes

=======
10.11.2014 - Version 2.5
New C++ backend interfacable through Matlab (mts). New C++ part co-developed 
with Zenna Tavares (MIT).
*resolves some numerical issues with large graphs
*some added options for new variants of computing stability
*greater efficiency on some parts in the code

=======
1.1.2016 -- Version 3.0
Fully rewritten interface with more modular structure for easier extension (mts)
* default name of function is now partition_stability to avoid confusion with older version.
* eigendecomposition as option to compute matrix exponential
* parallelisation possible over different markov times (new default)
* faster variation of information computations
* lots of small changes ...
* new C++ backend is now the default, old version available in separate folder

=======
1. October 2018 -- release in new repository
