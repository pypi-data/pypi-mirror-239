# Python connect to PLC LS by TCP XGT Server

LS protocol(LS electric Communication Protocol) implementation by Python. LS protocol enables you to operate PLC from computer.

from PyXGT.LS import plc_ls

# connect to PLC

conn = plc_ls("192.168.1.10",2004) #PLC LS IP and port: 2004 (TCP XGT server)

val = conn.command("XGB", "write", "bit", "M70") or conn.command("XGB", "write", "bit", "M70","0") # Write OFF to Bit M70

val = conn.command("XGB", "write", "byte", "D100","20") # Write 20 to 100th Byte(int8) D50( beacause 1 D= int16)
