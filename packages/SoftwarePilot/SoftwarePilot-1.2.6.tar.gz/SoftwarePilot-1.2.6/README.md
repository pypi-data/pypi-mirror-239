# SoftwarePilot
SoftwarePilot is an open source middleware and API that supports aerial applications. SoftwarePilot allows users to connect consumer Parrot Anafi drones to programmable pythonscripts that provide access to the drones flight controller, camera, and navigation system as well as custom rest api and dockerfile integration.

(Streaming features are currently bugged)

## Getting Started
Install the library:
1. Clone the repo
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/boredbot2/SoftwarePilot.git
  ```
2. Pip install
  ```sh
  pip install SoftwarePilot
  ```
## Examples
1. Simple Start:
  ```sh
	from SoftwarePilot import SoftwarePilot

	'''
	This is short demo demonstrating how to connect to the drone, and execute a few basic commands
	'''

	sp = SoftwarePilot()

	# Setup a parrot anafi drone, connected through a controller, without a specific download directory
	drone = sp.setup_drone("parrot_anafi", 1, "None")

	drone.connect()

	drone.piloting.takeoff()

	# The drone will move forward 2 meters (x, y, z, angle)
	drone.piloting.move_by(2,0,0,0, wait = True)

	drone.piloting.land()

	drone.disconnect()
  ```
2. Handling Media
  ```sh
	from SoftwarePilot import SoftwarePilot
	import time

	'''
	This is short demo demonstrating how to get drone media
	'''

	sp = SoftwarePilot()

	# Setup a parrot anafi drone, connected through a controller, without a specific download directory
	drone = sp.setup_drone("parrot_anafi", 1, "None")

	drone.connect()

	# Without a specified directory, media will be automatically downloaded to AnafiMedia/

	# Example of how to setup, take, and download photos
	drone.camera.media.setup_photo()
	drone.camera.media.take_photo()
	drone.camera.media.download_last_media()

	# Example of how to setup, take, and download recordings
	drone.camera.media.setup_recording()
	drone.camera.media.start_recording()
	time.sleep(5)
	drone.camera.media.stop_recording()
	drone.camera.media.download_last_media()

	# Example of how to setup and process video live feed
	drone.camera.media.setup_stream(
		yuv_frame_processing = "None", 
		yuv_frame_cb = "None",
		h264_frame_cb = "None",
		start_cb = "None",
		end_cb = "None",
		flush_cb = "None",
	)
	# All the callbacks are optional and are automatically set to "None"
	# When set to default the stream will download all the frames and provide framerate and bitrate metadata
	drone.camera.media.start_stream()
	time.sleep(5)
	drone.camera.media.stop_stream()

	drone.disconnect()
	# *Renderer is currently out of service
  ```
3. Service Interaction
  ```sh
	from SoftwarePilot import SoftwarePilot
	import time

	'''
	This is a short demo demonstrating how to boot up a dockerized service and requesting it with SoftwarePilot

	SoftwarePilot provides a python template of a Rest API which the user is meant to modify and dockerize
	This API is meant to offload the image processing workload to a more capable machine
	SoftwarePilot does not limit the service to which it will connect to, but the basic structure must be followed for proper behavior
	'''

	sp = SoftwarePilot()

	sp.setup_docker()
	time.sleep(5)

	# REPLACE : DOCKER_IMAGE
	container = sp.docker.deploy_container("DOCKER_IMAGE", detach = True, ports = {8000:8000})

	ip_host = sp.get_host_ip()
	service = sp.setup_service(ip_address = ip_host)
	response = service.get()
	print(response)

	# REPLACE : IMAGE_PATH
	response = service.run("IMAGE_PATH")
	print(response)
  ```
4. All Together
  ```sh
	from SoftwarePilot import SoftwarePilot
	import time

	'''
	This is a short demo combining all the utilies demonstrated
	'''
	sp = SoftwarePilot()

	sp.setup_docker()
	time.sleep(5)
	# Dockerize SoftwarePilotAPITest and replace "DOCKER_IMAGE" for your custom name
	container = sp.docker.deploy_container("DOCKER_IMAGE", detach = True, ports = {8000:8000})

	ip_host = sp.get_host_ip()
	service = sp.setup_service(ip_address = ip_host)

	response = service.get()
	print(response)

	download_dir = service.get_download_path()
	drone = sp.setup_drone("parrot_anafi", 1, download_dir)
	drone.connect()

	drone.camera.media.setup_photo()
	drone.piloting.takeoff()

	num_img = 0
	while (num_img < 20):
		drone.camera.media.take_photo()
		image_path = drone.camera.media.download_last_media()
		
		response = service.run(image_path)
		print(response)
		drone.piloting.move_by(response['x'], response['y'], response['z'], response['angle'])
		
		num_img += 1

	drone.piloting.land()	

	drone.disconnect()	
  ```
5. Async Flight
  ```sh
  	from SoftwarePilot import SoftwarePilot
  	
  	'''
  	This is a short demo demonstrating how asynchronous flight
  	'''
  	
  	sp = SoftwarePilot()
  	drone = sp.setup_drone("parrot_anafi", 1, download_dir)
	drone.connect()
	
	drone.piloting.takeoff(queue = True)
	drone.piloting.move_by(2, 0, 0, 0, wait=True, queue=True)
	drone.piloting.land(queue = True)
	
	drone.piloting.execute_actions()
	
	drone.disconnect()
  
  ```
