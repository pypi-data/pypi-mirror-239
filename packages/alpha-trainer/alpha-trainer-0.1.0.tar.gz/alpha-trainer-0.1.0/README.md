# Alpha Trainer - Machine Learning Game Training Framework

The Alpha Trainer package is a versatile framework designed for training machine learning models for custom games. It simplifies the process of training and evaluating models on custom game environments. This README provides an overview of the package and focuses on the main function, `simulate_game`.

## Installation

You can install the `alpha_trainer` package using pip:

```bash
pip install alpha_trainer
```

The "Example" section now includes a code snippet showing how to use the `simulate_game` function within the README.md file. You can customize the example to match your specific use case and provide more detailed information as needed.


### Example

Here's an example of how to use the `simulate_game` function:

```python
from alpha_trainer import simulate_game, AlphaTrainableGame, AlphaMove

# Define your custom game class
class MyGame(AlphaTrainableGame):
    # Implement your custom game logic here

# Simulate a game and collect data
game_results = simulate_game(MyGame, num_simulations=1000, model=my_model)

# Use the collected data to train and evaluate your machine learning model
# ...
```
