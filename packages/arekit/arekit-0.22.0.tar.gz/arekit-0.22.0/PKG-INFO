        **AREkit** (Attitude and Relation Extraction Toolkit) -- is a python toolkit, devoted to 
        document level Attitude and Relation Extraction between text objects from mass-media news 
        and analytical articles with entity-linking (EL) API support for objects.
        
        ## Description
        
        Is an open-source and extensible toolkit focused on data preparation for document-level relation extraction organization. 
        In complements the OpenNRE functionality since *document-level RE setting is not widely explored* (2.4 [[paper]](https://aclanthology.org/D19-3029.pdf)).
        The core functionality includes 
        (1) API for document presentation with EL (Entity Linking, i.e. Object Synonymy) support 
        for sentence level relations preparation (dubbed as contexts)
        (2) API for contexts extraction
        (3) relations transferring from sentence-level onto document-level, and more.
        It providers contrib modules of 
        **neural networks** (like OpenNRE) and 
        **BERT**,
        both applicable for sentiment attitude extraction task.
