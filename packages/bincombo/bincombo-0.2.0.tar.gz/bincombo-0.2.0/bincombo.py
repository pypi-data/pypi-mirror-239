"""
Make any type binary-combinable with a single line of code.

The most obvious use case arguably is the creation of binary expressions over custom
types, but ``bincombo`` is not limited to combination of boolean values.
By providing appropriate map/reduce operations, any type of data of the discrete
members of a combination can be aggregated to form a combined result.

The implementation solely relies on inheritance, no meta programming is involved.
You are free to use your own metaclasses, should you wish to do so.

Suppose you have a custom type ``Check``, which accepts or rejects values depending
on the result of the invocation of some callable.
You can make instances of it combinable using the binary operators `&` (and) and `|`
(or) and also support the unary `~` (invert) by using the ``combinable()`` decorator::

    import bincombo

    @bincombo.combinable(methods=("check",))
    class Check:
        __slots__ = ("checker",)

        def __init__(self, checker):
            self.checker = checker

        def check(self, value):
            return self.checker(value)

Now, ``Check`` objects can be binary-combined::

    c1 = Check(lambda v: isinstance(v, int) and v >= 42)
    c2 = Check(lambda v: isinstance(v, str))
    c3 = Check(lambda v: "hello" in v)
    c = c1 | c2 & ~c3
    c.check(41)  # False
    c.check(42)  # True
    c.check("hello, world!")  # False
    c.check("hey, world!")  # True

The ``combinable()`` decorator creates a number of types needed to represent discrete
checks and combinations thereof.
These are stored in a ``Config`` object, which is aavailable as class attribute
``BIN_CONFIG`` of ``Check``.
It can be worth storing these types as module attributes alongside your ``Check``
class to have them at hand for explicit use or type checking::

    BaseCheck = Check.BIN_CONFIG.base_type
    CheckCombo = Check.BIN_CONFIG.combo_type
    AllChecks = Check.BIN_CONFIG.and_type
    AnyCheck = Check.BIN_CONFIG.or_type

All types in this module have ``__slots__`` defined for smaller memory footprints
and improved lookup times, as have the types created by ``combinable()``.
It is recommended to also equip your own type with ``__slots__`` if possible to
benefit from entirely ``__dict__``-less objects.

To gain a better understanding of how all the types relate or to further customize
them, here is how you would make ``Check`` binary-combinable without using the
``combinable()`` helper::

    # This is a base class from which both the discrete Check type and the type
    # representing a combination of Check objects will inherit.
    # It can be used, for instance, to test whether some object is Check-like
    # using isinstance(obj, BaseCheck).
    class BaseCheck:
        __slots__ = ()

    # Check should support all three operations.
    feature_mixins = (
        bincombo.AndSupportMixin, bincombo.OrSupportMixin, bincombo.InvertSupportMixin
    )

    # This is the type that would normally be returned by combinable() decorator.
    # Here it replaces the original Check, but you could also give it a different name.
    class Check(*feature_mixins, Check, BaseCheck):
        __slots__ = ()

    # Objects of this type represent (possibly negated) AND/OR combinations of
    # Check objects.
    class CheckCombo(*feature_mixins, bincombo.Combo, BaseCheck):
        __slots__ = ()

        # Create a proxy check() method that queries an individual combo member.
        # bincombo will call this method for all members, combining the returned
        # boolean values using and/or, depending on the combination type, and possibly
        # invert the final result.
        @bincombo.combine_members
        def check(self, member, value):
            return member.check(value)

    # This is an AND combination.
    class AllChecks(bincombo.AndComboMixin, CheckCombo):
        __slots__ = ()

    # This is an OR combination.
    class AnyCheck(bincombo.OrComboMixin, CheckCombo):
        __slots__ = ()

    # Finally, bincombo has to be taught all the types just created.
    # By attaching the Config object to BaseCheck as a class attribute, both Check
    # and CheckCombo instances will have it available due to inheritance.
    BaseCheck.BIN_CONFIG = bincombo.Config(
        BaseCheck, Check, CheckCombo, AllChecks, AnyCheck
    )

Further customization of the combining abilities is possible, the documentations of
``combinable()``, ``combine_members()`` and ``Config`` have more information.

    Class decorator for making a type binary-combinable.

    It does not alter the original type, instead it creates a binary-combinable
    subtype (plus some auxiliary types) and returns it.
    This decorator is a shorthand that should be sufficient for most use cases.
    The general process of making a type binary-combinable using ``bincombo`` is
    shown in the module's docstring.

    Parameters:

    * ``original_type``:
      The type to be made binary-combinable.
      Does not need to be given explicitly if used as class decorator.
    * ``methods``:
      Tuple of method names of the discrete type which should also be available on
      combinations thereof.
      The ``combine_members()`` helper is utilized to combine boolean method call
      results of the individual combination members according to the type of relation
      (& or |).
      If, instead of just method names, two-tuples ``(name, meth)`` are given, ``meth``
      is directly used as the method implementation on the created ``Combo``
      subtype.
      This allows to call ``combine_members()`` with custom map/reduce configurations
      for combining non-boolean results, or to implement a completely different
      scheme of member aggregation.
    * ``properties``:
      Like ``methods``, except that plain attribute lookups are performed on the
      members instead of method calls.
      Also, in case of two-tuples, the function will be wrapped using ``property()``,
      so don't do that yourself.
    * ``support_and``:
      Whether objects should support combination using the `&` operator.
    * ``support_or``:
      Whether objects should support combination using the `|` operator.
    * ``support_invert``:
      Whether objects should support logical negation using the `~` unary operator.
    * ``base_name``:
      ``str.format()``-style pattern for the base type's ``__name__``.
      The placeholder `{name}` inserts the original type's ``__name__``, `{cap_name}`
      is the same with capital first letter.
    * ``discrete_name``:
      ``str.format()``-style pattern for the discrete type's ``__name__``.
      Placeholders are the same as for ``base_name``.
    * ``combo_name``:
      ``str.format()``-style pattern for the ``Combo`` subtype's ``__name__``.
      Placeholders are the same as for ``base_name``.
    * ``and_name``:
      ``str.format()``-style pattern for the AND type's ``__name__``.
      Placeholders are the same as for ``base_name``.
    * ``or_name``:
      ``str.format()``-style pattern for the AND type's ``__name__``.
      Placeholders are the same as for ``base_name``.

    At least one of ``support_and`` and ``support_or`` needs to be ``True``, a

    """
    Decorator for methods of ``Combo`` subclasses that combines members in a
    map-and-reduce fashion.

    The decorated method is called iteratively for each member of the combination,
    passing the member as first argument, followed by the original positional and
    keyword arguments, so that it can work out and return the member's result,
    e.g. by proxying the method call.

    The decorator then combines results using AND/OR operations, depending on the
    combination's type, and possibly inverts the result.
    These operations are configurable via parameters, the defaults are suitable for
    combining boolean values and behave like the ``all()`` and ``any()`` builtins.
    For instance, with default operations in the AND-case, a call is equivalent to::

        all(meth(self, member, *args, **kwargs) for member in self.members)

    Parameters:

    * ``meth``:
      The method which maps members to member results as described above.
      Does not need to be given explicitly if used as decorator.
    * ``and_``:
      A three-tuple that configures how to combine member results in the AND case:
      * initial value: this is also returned for empty combinations
      * combine operator: this is called for each member with two arguments: the
        current value and the member's result, its return becomes the current value
      * stop condition: this is called before processing the next member with the
        current value as argument, if it returns something that evaluates to ``True``,
        no more members are processed
    * ``or_``:
      A three-tuple that configures how to combine member results in the OR case:
      See ``and_`` for descriptions of the tuple elements.
    * ``invert``:
      In case the combination is a negated one, this callable is called with the
      final result and has to return the inverse value.
