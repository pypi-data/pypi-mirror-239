To download bomcheck.cfg from the github site, right click on "bomcheck.cfg"
and pick "Save link as...".

bomcheck.cfg is a file you can alter to to suit your needs.  Let the bomcheck
program know where the altered file is located via the command line, or if
you're using bomcheckgui, set the location in the settings menu.

bomcheck.cfg can be edited with a text editor program like notepad or wordpad.
Wordpad is preferrered because it tends to handle end-of-line characters
properly (lines don't run off the screen).
