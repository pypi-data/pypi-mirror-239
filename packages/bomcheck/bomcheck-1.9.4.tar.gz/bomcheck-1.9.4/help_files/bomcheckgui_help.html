    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

    <p>The bomcheck program was originally written to be run from a Command
      Prompt Terminal
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe">(cmd.exe)</a>.
      The program <i>bomcheckgui</i> is actually a wrapper that presents a
      graphical user interface (gui) for the bomcheck program. That is, bomcheckgui
      runs the bomcheck program in the background.  See
      <a href="bomcheck_help.html">bomcheck_help.html</a> for info about how bomcheck works.
    </p>


    <h2 id="run">How to run bomcheckgui:</h2>

    <p>Drag and drop the BOM files that you want to be checked onto the
      central portion of the gui. File names that do not end with _sw.xlsx or
      sl_xlsx will be ignored. Files that contain a tilde character, ~, will
      also be ignored.</p>

    <p>Press the green check button icon to have your BOMs analyzed. To print
      results or save results to a csv file, click the boxes located at the
      bottom of the pop up window containing results.  See
      <a href="https://www.copytrans.net/support/how-to-open-a-csv-file-in-excel/">
      how to open a csv file in Excel.</a></p>

    <p>If you wish to check other BOM files, push the clear button to clear the
      list of files. Then drag and drop the new files you want checked.</p>

    <p>If at some point in your work day you close the folder that contains
      your BOMs, and later you want to reopen it to make changes, instead of
      having to search for that folder again, click on the folder icon.
      The folder will open.</p>

    <p><b>Tip 1:</b> Instead of dragging individual file names into the
      bomcheckgui program, you can drag in the folder that contains the files
      that are to be checked. Then once the program is run, the program's action
      will be to do a bom check of the files in that folder. The advantage of
      doing it this way is that files in a Microsoft File Explorer window can
      be updated without having to clear previous selections and reinserting
      new files.</p>

    <p><b>Tip 2:</b> Save yourself some keystrokes: Instead of placing the
      multilevel BOM from SyteLine into the folder that contains the SolidWorks
      BOMs, copy the multilevel SyteLine BOM to the clipboard. Bomcheck will
      find that BOM in the clipboard and will use it for evaluation.
      (To copy to the clipboard, open up the SyteLine BOM in Excel, click the
      empty cell located to the left of the column header named "A", and then
      do a Ctrl-C.)</p>
