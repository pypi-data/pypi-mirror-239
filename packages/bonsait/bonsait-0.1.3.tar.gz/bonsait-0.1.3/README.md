# BonsaiT: an Interface for BONSAI classifications

BonsaiT is a Python package for the standardization of classifications in Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA). It leverages NLP to aligns external classification systems with the BONSAI framework, ensuring data consistency across LCA datasets.

Key components include the `Encoder`, which converts text to vectors via language models like Sentence Transformers and Hugging Face's BERT, and the `BonsaiTransformer`, which identifies the BONSAI class most similar to a given source class through vector analysis and cosine similarity.

BonsaiT streamlines LCA data harmonization, enabling more accurate environmental impact assessments.

## Installation

To get started with BonsaiT, install it via pip:
```Bash
pip install bonsait
```

## Quick start

Hereâ€™s how to quickly implement BonsaiT in your project:

```Python
from bonsait import BonsaiTransformer

source_class = "electricity from coal"

# Set up the BonsaiTransformer with your source classification
class_transformer = BonsaiTransformer(source_class=source_class)

# Perform the transformation to find the BONSAI equivalent
transformed_class = class_transformer.transform()
print(f"The source classification <{source_class}> is transformed into BONSAI classification: <{transformed_class}>")
```
