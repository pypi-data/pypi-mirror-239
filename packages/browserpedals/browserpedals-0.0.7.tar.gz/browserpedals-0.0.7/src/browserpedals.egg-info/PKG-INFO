Control any video or audio in a web browser with foot pedals (pause/play or jump back),
even when the web browser is not in focus (for example, while typing in text editor).

| This may be helpful during transcribing (listening to a video and typing the spoken text).
| The program will attempt to recognize new foot pedals automatically.
| There is an option to create subtitles: After every Play and Pause using pedals,
| SRT subtitle timing for the played video fragment is copied to clipboard and can be pasted
| into any text file before corresponding text fragment to make it an SRT subtitle.
| There is an option to periodically pause a video and copy timestamps to clipboard.
| (Under the hood, the program uses Selenium project to control the browser.)

$ python3 -m pip install --no-cache-dir browserpedals
