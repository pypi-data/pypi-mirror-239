- **Data Visualizations**: Word clouds, graphs, and more.
- **Custom Instructions**: All your custom instructions in one JSON file.

See examples [here](assets/demo).

## Getting Started

Ensure you have **Python** and **Git** installed. If not:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### 1. Export Your ChatGPT Data 🗂

- Sign in at [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com).
- Navigate: Profile Name (bottom left) -> **Settings** -> **Data controls** -> **Export** -> **Confirm export**.
- Await email from OpenAI and download the `.zip` file.

### 2. Copy the Tool to Your Computer 📥

- Open a program called "terminal" or "command prompt".

- Type (and hit enter after each line):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohamed-chs/chatgpt-history-export-to-md.git
```

```bash
cd chatgpt-history-export-to-md
```

This will copy this GitHub repository on your computer, and navigate to the root directory.

### 3. Set Up the Environment 🛠️

Type (and hit enter):

```bash
python env.py
```

This will create a virtual environment and install the necessary python libraries.

#### Activate the virtual environment

**On Linux or MacOS:**

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**On Windows:**

Using Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`):

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Using PowerShell:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

If you encounter an error about script execution in PowerShell, try running:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 4. Run the Script 🏃‍♂️

With the environment set up, you can now run the script. In the terminal or command prompt, execute:

```bash
python cli.py
```

Now, follow the instructions on screen and choose your desired options, the script will handle the rest.

### 5. Check the Output 🎉

And that's it! After running the script, head over to the output folder to see your nice word clouds, graphs, and neatly formatted Markdown files. Enjoy !

## Notes

This project requires Python 3.8.7 or higher if on Windows. See [known issue](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/issues/1023#issue-534396318)

This is just a small thing I coded to help me see my convos in beautiful markdown, in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (my go-to note-taking app).

I wasn't a fan of the clunky, and sometimes paid, browser extensions.

I'm working on automating it to add new conversations and updating old ones. Had some luck with a JavaScript bookmarklet, still ironing it out tho. Shouldn't take long.
