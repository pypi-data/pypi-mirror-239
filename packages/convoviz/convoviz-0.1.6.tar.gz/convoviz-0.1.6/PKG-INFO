## Notes

This project requires Python 3.8.7 or higher if on Windows. See [known issue](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/issues/1023#issue-534396318)

This is just a small thing I coded to help me see my convos in beautiful markdown, in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (my go-to note-taking app).

I wasn't a fan of the clunky, and sometimes paid, browser extensions.

It was also a great opportunity to learn more about Python and type annotations. I had mypy, pyright, and ruff all on strict mode, 'twas fun.

It also works as package, so you can **import** it in your own projects, and use the models and functions as you wish. I need to add more documentation for that tho. Feel free to reach out if you need help.

I'm working on automating it to add new conversations and updating old ones. Had some luck with a JavaScript bookmarklet, still ironing it out tho. Shouldn't take long.
