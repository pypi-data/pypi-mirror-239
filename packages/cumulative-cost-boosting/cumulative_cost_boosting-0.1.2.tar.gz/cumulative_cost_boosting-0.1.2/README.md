# AdaCC: Adaptive Cost-sensitive Boosting for Imbalanced Data

## Overview
AdaCC is a novel cost-sensitive boosting approach designed to address the challenge of class imbalance in machine learning. Traditional supervised learning models often exhibit bias towards the majority class, leading to under-performance in minority classes. Cost-sensitive learning attempts to mitigate this issue by treating classes differently, employing a fixed misclassification cost matrix provided by users. However, manually tuning these parameters can be daunting and might lead to suboptimal results if not done accurately.

In this work, we introduce AdaCC, a groundbreaking method that dynamically adjusts misclassification costs over boosting rounds based on the model's performance. Unlike conventional approaches, AdaCC eliminates the need for fixed misclassification cost matrices, offering a parameter-free solution. By leveraging the cumulative behavior of the boosting model, AdaCC automatically adapts misclassification costs for subsequent boosting rounds, ensuring optimal balance between classes and enhancing predictive accuracy.


The following example showcases how the weighting strategy of AdaCC differs from AdaBoost. Feel free to also read the technical paper of this approach ["AdaCC: cumulative cost-sensitive boosting for imbalanced classification"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10115-022-01780-8)
