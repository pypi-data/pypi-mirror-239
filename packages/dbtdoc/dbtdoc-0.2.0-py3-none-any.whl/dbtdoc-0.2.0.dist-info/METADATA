# dbtdoc
Create dbt document from SQL files

## Install
```
pip install dbtdoc
```



## Features
Currently support document for following
- model
- seed
- common macro and test
- materialization

## Usage

### Prepare
dbtdoc will extract the information from SQL comment block /* */ for each macro and test.

A typical comment block will look like this:

~~~
/*
This information will be used in dbt document.
Information insides dbt block is used to create dbt yml file 
```dbt
arguments:
  - name: arg01
    type: string
    description: the first argument
```
* any thing after `dbt` block will be ignored
*/
~~~

By default, every macro, tests will be displayed in dbt document navigator. 
Remove item from document by adding following setting.

~~~
/*
this will no be displayed in dbt doc
```dbt
docs:
   show: false
```
*/
~~~

### Usage
Default syntax is below: 
```
dbtdoc [-h] [-v] [-c] [-b] [-d DOC] [-u] [-o] [-p PREFIX] [-r] [-s SCHEMA] [-S] [-D DEBUG] [-T TARGET]
```

By default `dbtdoc` scans the default DBT project directory (consulting the `DBT_PROJECT_DIR` environment variable if set or the current directory if the environment variable is unset) and all of its sub-folders for sql files, creates 2 file `dbt_schema.yml` and `docs.md` for each folder (the names of the file could be changed by .dbtdoc)
If `dbtdoc` finds a `dbt_project.yml` file in the target folder, it will only scan the folders defined by `model-paths`, `macro-paths`, and `test-paths` in that configuration file.

Parameter `-o` can be used to limit `dbtdoc` to only process the root folder and ignore its sub-folders.

Note: when error happens, use the command with `-D DEBUG` for more details about the errors.


## Configuration

A configuration file `.dbtdoc` is searched in the current folder. A typical configuration file looks like this:
```.dbtdoc
schema_file: "dbt_schema.yml"
doc_file: "docs.md"
quote_string: true
```

If the configuration does not exists, default values are used.
```
SCHEMA_FILE = "dbt_schema.yml"
DOC_FILE = "docs.md"
QUOTE_STRING = False
```

## Other
This project was inspired by [dbt_docstring](https://github.com/anelendata/dbt_docstring).
