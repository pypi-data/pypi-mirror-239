": "Title: \"Ontology Engineering and Conceptual Graphs: A New Approach to Knowledge Representation in Logic Programming\"\n\nAbstract: \nThis paper explores the integration of ontology engineering and conceptual graphs in the realm of logic programming, with a focus on knowledge representation. The study delves into the intricacies of knowledge representation formalism and its pivotal role in the development of knowledge-based systems. The paper further elucidates how ontology engineering and conceptual graphs can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of knowledge representation, thereby improving the overall performance of logic programming. The findings of this research could potentially revolutionize the way knowledge is represented and processed in logic programming, opening new avenues for advancements in the field of artificial intelligence and computer science."
