Itemize your answer, one sentence per line.": "1. Purchase a tire repair kit from an auto parts store or online. The kit should include a plug and a tool to insert it.\n2. Locate the puncture in the tire. This can often be done by visually inspecting the tire for a nail or other object, or by listening for a hissing sound.\n3. Once the puncture is located, remove any foreign object that may be stuck in the tire using a pair of pliers.\n4. Use the rasp tool, which should be included in your tire repair kit, to prepare the hole. Insert the rasp tool into the puncture and move it up and down a few times to roughen the inside.\n5. Take a plug from your repair kit and insert it into the insertion tool. The plug should be threaded through the eye of the insertion tool.\n6. Apply rubber cement (if included in your kit) to the plug for a better seal.\n7. Insert the plug into the puncture using the insertion tool. Push the tool into the tire until about half of the plug is inside.\n8. Pull the insertion tool out quickly, leaving the plug inside the tire.\n9. Cut off any excess plug material sticking out of the tire using a knife.\n10. Inflate the tire to its recommended pressure using an air pump.\n11. Check the repair by listening for a hissing sound or applying soapy water to the area. If bubbles form, there is still a leak and the process may need to be repeated.\n12. Once the tire is holding air without leaking, it can be put back on the vehicle or the vehicle can be lowered off the jack stands.",

They have specialized tools and expertise to effectively repair the tire, ensuring it s safe to use again\", step by step, while ensuring steps are consistent with each other. Itemize your answer, one sentence per line.": "1. First, locate a professional tire repair shop near your location. You can do this by searching online or asking for recommendations.\n2. Once you have found a suitable repair shop, call them to inquire about their services and confirm if they can repair your specific tire.\n3. If the tire is still on your vehicle, you may need to remove it. To do this, you will need a car jack and a lug wrench. Make sure you are parked on a flat, stable surface before you begin.\n4. Use the car jack to lift the vehicle off the ground and the lug wrench to remove the lug nuts holding the tire in place.\n5. Once the tire is removed, place it in your vehicle. Make sure to also bring your spare tire, if you have one, so you can use it while your flat tire is being repaired.\n6. Drive or have your vehicle towed to the repair shop.\n7. At the repair shop, explain the issue to the technician and leave your tire with them for repair.\n8. Once the tire is repaired, they will contact you to pick it up.\n9. After picking up the repaired tire, you will need to put it back on your vehicle. Use the car jack to lift the vehicle, place the tire back on, and secure it with the lug nuts.\n10. Finally, lower your vehicle back to the ground using the car jack and make sure the lug nuts are tightened properly.\n11. It's advisable to check the tire pressure and adjust it if necessary before driving again.",

Itemize your answer, one sentence per line.": "1. Purchase a can of tire sealant from an auto parts store or online.\n2. Ensure your vehicle is in a safe and stable position before starting the repair.\n3. Remove the valve cap from the flat tire.\n4. Attach the hose from the can of tire sealant to the valve stem on the tire.\n5. Release the sealant into the tire by pressing the button or trigger on the can.\n6. The sealant will inflate the tire and plug the hole from the inside.\n7. Once the tire is inflated, replace the valve cap.\n8. Drive your vehicle slowly for a few miles to allow the sealant to spread evenly inside the tire and fully seal the puncture.\n9. Check the tire pressure to ensure it's at the recommended level, adding more air if necessary.\n10. Monitor the tire closely over the next few days to ensure the sealant is holding and the tire remains inflated."
