# earfcn

Convert downlink EARFCN to frequency and vice versa.
EARFCN -> frequency converts to MHz.
frequency -> EARFCN can take Hz or MHz as input.

Multiple EARFCNs map to the same downlink frequency, so freq2earfcn returns a list of possible (band, EARFCN) values.

## Examples
```python
from earfcn.convert import earfcn2freq, earfcn2band, freq2earfcn

earfcn2freq(3350)  # 2680.0
earfcn2band(3350)  # 7
freq2earfcn(2680)  # [(7, 3350), (41, 41490)]
```

## Command Line Tools
Installing this package also installs two command line utilities `earfcn2freq` and `freq2earfcn`.
Each takes one argument and outputs to stdout.

```shell
earfcn2freq 3350
```
```
2680.0
```

```shell
freq2earfcn 2680
```
```
band=7, earfcn=3350
band=41, earfcn=41490
```
