# EasyLLM

EasyLLM is an open source project that provides helpful tools and methods for working with large language models (LLMs), both open source and closed source. 

EasyLLM implements clients that are compatible with OpenAI's Completion API. This means you can easily replace `openai.ChatCompletion` with, for example, `huggingface.ChatCompletion`.

* [ChatCompletion Clients](./clients)
* [Prompt Utils](./prompt_utils)
* [Examples](./examples)

## üöÄ Getting Started

Install EasyLLM via pip:

```bash
pip install easyllm
```

Then import and start using the clients:

```python

from easyllm.clients import huggingface

# helper to build llama2 prompt
huggingface.prompt_builder = "llama2"

response = huggingface.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant speaking like a pirate. argh!"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is the sun?"},
    ],
    temperature=0.9,
    top_p=0.6,
    max_tokens=256,
)

print(response)
```
the result will look like 

```bash
{
  "id": "hf-lVC2iTMkFJ",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1690661144,
  "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf",
  "choices": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": " Arrrr, the sun be a big ol' ball o' fire in the sky, me hearty! It be the source o' light and warmth for our fair planet, and it be a mighty powerful force, savvy? Without the sun, we'd be sailin' through the darkness, lost and cold, so let's give a hearty \"Yarrr!\" for the sun, me hearties! Arrrr!"
      },
      "finish_reason": null
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 111,
    "completion_tokens": 299,
    "total_tokens": 410
  }
}
```

## üí™üèª Migration from OpenAI to HuggingFace

Migrating from OpenAI to HuggingFace is easy. Just change the import statement and the client you want to use and optionally the prompt builder.

```diff
- import openai
+ from easyllm.clients import huggingface
+ huggingface.prompt_builder = "llama2"


- response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
+ response = huggingface.ChatCompletion.create(
-    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
+    model="meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Knock knock."},
    ],
)
```

Make sure when you switch your client that your hyperparameters are still valid. For example, `temperature` of GPT-3 might be different than `temperature` of `Llama-2`.

## ‚òëÔ∏è Key Features

### ü§ù Compatible Clients

- Implementation of clients compatible with OpenAI API format of `openai.ChatCompletion`.
- Easily switch between different LLMs like `openai.ChatCompletion` and `huggingface.ChatCompletion` by changing one line of code. 
- Support for streaming of completions, checkout example [How to stream completions](examples/stream-chat-completions).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Helper Modules ‚öôÔ∏è

- `evol_instruct` (work in progress) - Use evolutionary algorithms create instructions for LLMs.

- `prompt_utils` - Helper methods to easily convert between prompt formats like OpenAI Messages to prompts for open source models like Llama 2.
