    "# How to use Chat Completion clients with Amazon SageMaker\n",
    "\n",
    "EasyLLM can be used as an abstract layer to replace `gpt-3.5-turbo` and `gpt-4` with open source models.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can change your own applications from the OpenAI API, by simply changing the client. \n",
    "\n",
    "Chat models take a series of messages as input, and return an AI-written message as output.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide illustrates the chat format with a few example API calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0. Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can use `easyllm` with Amazon SageMaker you need to deploy the model to a SageMaker endpoint. You can do this by following one of the bloh posts below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Deploy Llama 2 7B/13B/70B on Amazon SageMaker](https://www.philschmid.de/sagemaker-llama-llm)\n",
    "* [Deploy Falcon 7B & 40B on Amazon SageMaker](https://www.philschmid.de/sagemaker-falcon-llm)\n",
    "* [Introducing the Hugging Face LLM Inference Container for Amazon SageMaker](https://www.philschmid.de/sagemaker-huggingface-llm)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your endpoint deploy copy the endpoint name of it. The endpoint name will be our `model` paramter. You can get the endpoint name in the AWS management console for Amazon SageMaker under \"Inference\" -> \"Endpoints\" -> \"Name\" or when you deployed your model using the sagemaker sdk you can get it from the `predictor.endpoint_name` attribute.\n"

    "- `model`: the name of the model you want to use (e.g., `huggingface-pytorch-tgi-inference-2023-08-08-14-15-52-703`) or leave it empty to just call the api\n",

    "\n",
    "Compared to OpenAI api is the `huggingface` module also exposing a `prompt_builder` and `stop_sequences` parameter you can use to customize the prompt and stop sequences. The EasyLLM package comes with prompt builder utilities.\n",

      "Asynchronous programming, you see, is like solving a complex equation. *writes on board* You have a problem that requires immediate attention, but you can't just sit there and wait for the solution to appear. *mimes a person twiddling their thumbs* No, no, my young apprentice! You must use your powers of creativity and ingenuity to find a way to solve the problem in parallel! *winks*\n",
      "Now, in math, we often use techniques like substitution, elimination, or even the occasional trickery of complex numbers to solve equations. *nods* But in asynchronous programming, we use something called \"asynchronous operations\" to tackle problems that require more than just a simple \"wait and see\" approach. *smirks*\n",
      "Think of it like this: imagine you have a bunch of tasks that need to be done, but they can't all be done at the same time. Maybe you have to fetch some data from a database, process it, and then perform some calculations. *mimes typing on a keyboard* But wait! You can't just sit there and wait for each task to finish, or you'll be twiddling your thumbs for hours! *chuckles*\n",
      "So, what do you do? *smirks* You break each task into smaller, more manageable pieces, and you give each piece a special \"asynchronous hat\"! *winks* These hats allow each piece to work on its task independently, without waiting for the others to finish. *nods*\n",
      "For example, you could give one piece the task of fetching data from the database, another piece the task of processing it, and another piece the task of performing calculations. *mimes handing out hats* And then, you can just sit back and watch as each piece works on its task, without any of them waiting for the others to finish! *chuckles*\n",
      "But wait, there's more! *excitedly* With asynchronous programming, you can even use something called \"callbacks\" to make sure everything gets done in the right order! *nods* It's like having a team of highly skilled mathematicians working on your problem, each one using their own special hat to solve a different part of the equation! *smirks*\n",
      "So there you have it, my dear student! Asynchronous programming is like solving a complex equation, but instead of just waiting for the answer, you use your powers of creativity and ingenuity to find a way to solve it in parallel! *nods* Now, go forth and conquer those complex problems, my young apprentice! *winks*\n"
