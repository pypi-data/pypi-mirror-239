    "EasyLLM can be used as an abstract layer to replace `text-davinci-003` with open source models.\n",

    "You can change your own applications from the OpenAI API, by simply changing the client. \n",

    "Chat models take a series of messages as input, and return an AI-written message as output.\n",

    "## 0. Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can use `easyllm` with Amazon SageMaker you need to deploy the model to a SageMaker endpoint. You can do this by following one of the bloh posts below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Deploy Llama 2 7B/13B/70B on Amazon SageMaker](https://www.philschmid.de/sagemaker-llama-llm)\n",
    "* [Deploy Falcon 7B & 40B on Amazon SageMaker](https://www.philschmid.de/sagemaker-falcon-llm)\n",
    "* [Introducing the Hugging Face LLM Inference Container for Amazon SageMaker](https://www.philschmid.de/sagemaker-huggingface-llm)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your endpoint deploy copy the endpoint name of it. The endpoint name will be our `model` paramter. You can get the endpoint name in the AWS management console for Amazon SageMaker under \"Inference\" -> \"Endpoints\" -> \"Name\" or when you deployed your model using the sagemaker sdk you can get it from the `predictor.endpoint_name` attribute."
