# Lab-in-the-Field Experiments

Most of the experiments in this project are conducted in the lab. However, we also conduct experiments in the field. In the field, we can study the behavior of people in their natural environment. This is important because it allows us to study the behavior of people in a more realistic setting. However, it is also more difficult to control the environment and to ensure that the participants behave as we want them to.
