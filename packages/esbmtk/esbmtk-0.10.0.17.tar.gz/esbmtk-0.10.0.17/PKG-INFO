# ESBMTK - The  Earth-sciences box modeling toolkit

ESBMTK is a python library that aims to simplify typical box modeling projects in the Earth-Sciences. The basic API is now stable, but the code to deploy complex models is still being improved. See the tutorial at <https://esbmtk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ESBMTK-Tutorial.html>


# Todo

-   expand the documentation
-   provide more examples
-   do more testing
