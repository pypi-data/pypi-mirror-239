* ESBMTK - An Earth-sciences box modeling toolkit

ESBMTK is a python library that aims to simplify typical box modeling
projects in the Earth-Sciences. The general focus is to make box
modeling more approachable for classroom teaching. At present the code is under active development and the API changes frequently. 


* News

  - Oct. 30^{th}, 2023 v 0.10.0.0 This is a breaking change. Remineralization and
    photosynthesis must be implemented via functions, rather than transport
    connections. CS1 and CS2 are retired, and replaced by photosynthesis,
    organic-matter remineralization and carbonate-dissolution functions.
    I've started writing a user guide, see the Documentation folder. So far, only the very basics are covered. More to come!
 
  - July 28^{th}, 2023, v 0.9.0.1 The ODEPACk backend is now fully functional, and the basic API is more or less stable.

  - Nov. 11^{th} 2022, v 0.9.0.0 Moved to odepack based backend. Removed now defunct code. The odepack backend does not yet support isotope calculations.
  
  - 0.8.0.0
    - Cleanup of naming scheme which is now strictly hierarchical.
    - Bulk connection dictionaries now have to be specified as
      =source_to_sink= instead of =source2sink=.
    - The connection naming scheme has been revamped. Please see
      =esbmtk.connect.__set_name__()= documentation for details.
    - Model concentration units must now match 'mole/liter' or
      'mol/kg'. Concentrations can still be specified as =mmol/l= or
      =mmol/kg=, but model output will be in mole/liter or kg. At
      present, the model does not provide for the automatic conversion
      of mol/l to mol/kg. Thus you must specify units in a consistent
      way.
    - The SeawaterConstants class now always returns values as mol/kg solution. Caveat Emptor.
    - The SeawaterConstants class no longer accepts the 'model' keyword
    - All of his will break existing models.
    - Models assume by default that they deal with ideal water, i.e.,
      where the density equals one. To work with seawater, you must
      set =ideal_water=False=. In that case, you should also set the
      =concentration_unit= keyword to ='mol/kg'= (solution).
    - Several classes now require the "register" keyword. You may need to fix your code accordingly
    
  - The flux and connection summary methods can be filtered by more
    than one keyword. Provide a filter string in the following format
    ="keyword_1 keyword_2= and it will only return results that match
    both keywords.
  - Removed the dependency on the nptyping and number libraries

  - 0.7.3.9 Moved to setuptools build system. Lost of code fixes wrt
    isotope calculations, minor fixes in the carbonate module.

  - March 2^{nd} 0.7.3.4 =Flux_summary= now supports an =exclude=
    keyword. Hot fixed an error in the gas exchange code, which
    affected the total mass of atmosphere calculations. For the time
    being, the mass of the atmosphere is treated as constant.

  - 0.7.3.0 Flux data is no longer kept by default. This results in
    huge memory savings. esbmtk now requires python 3.9 or higher, and
    also depends on =os= and =psutil=. the scale with flux process now
    uses the =ref_flux= keyword instead of =ref_reservoirs=. Models must
    adapt their scripts accordingly. esbmtk objects no longer provide
    delta values by default. Rather they need to be calculated in the
    post-processing step via =M.get_delta_values()=. The =f_0= keyword in
    the weathering connection is now called =rate=. Using the old
    keyword will result in a unit error.

  - January 8^{th} 0.7.2.2 Fixed several isotope calculation
    regressions. Added 31 Unit tests.

  Older releases are mentioned in the Release History.

* Contributing

Don't be shy. Contributing is as easy as finding bugs by using the
code, or maybe you want to add a new process code? If you have plenty
of time to spare, ESMBTK could use a solver for stiff problems, or a
graphical interface ;-) See the todo section for ideas.


* Installation

ESBMTK relies on the following python versions and libraries

 - python >= 3.9
 - matplotlib
 - numpy
 - pandas
 - typing
 - pint

If you work with conda, it is recommended to install the above via
conda. If you work with pip, the installer should install these
libraries automatically. ESBMTK itself can be installed with pip

 - pip install esbmtk

* Documentation

The documentation is woefully out of date, at present, your best bet is the code itself

The API documentation is available at
https://uliw.github.io/esbmtk/esbmtk/index.html

# At present, I also provide the following example cases (as py-files
# and in jupyter notebook format)

#   - A trivial carbon cycle model which shows how to set up the model,
#     and read an external csv file to force the model.
#   - 
#  - The same model as be before but now to demonstrate how to add
 #   pyramid shaped signal, and how to use the rate constant process to
 #   adjust concentration dependent flux rates . [[https://github.com/uliw/esbmtk/blob/master/Examples/Using%20a%20rate%20constant/rate_example.org][concentration dependent flux rates]]

# Last but not least, I added a short [[https://github.com/uliw/esbmtk/blob/master/Documentation/Adding_your_own_Processes.org][guide how to add your own process
# classes to the ESBMTK]] 

* Todo

   - expand the documentation
   - provide more examples
   - do more testing
