<br><br><br>

## Quick Start

Install the package and run `context` to ask questions about the most up-to-date Python libraries. You will have to provide your OpenAI key to start a session.

```shell
pip install fleet-context
```
```shell
context
```

<br>

### Limit libraries

You can use the `-l` or `--libraries` followed by a list of libraries to limit your session to a certain number of libraries. Defaults to all.
```shell
context -l langchain pydantic openai
```

<br>

### Use a different OpenAI model

You can select a different OpenAI model by using `-m` or `--model`. Defaults to `gpt-4`. You can set your model to `gpt-4-32k` (if your organization has access), `gpt-3.5-turbo`, or `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k`.
```shell
context -m gpt-3.5-turbo
```

<br>

### Advanced settings

You can control the number of retrieved chunks by using `-k` or `--k_value` (defaulted to 10), and you can toggle whether the model cites its source by using `-c` or `--cite_sources` (defaults to true).
```shell
context -k 15 -c false
```




## Evaluations

### Results

#### Sampled libraries

We saw a 37-point improvement for gpt-4 generation scores across the board. We attribute this to a lack of knowledge for the most up-to-date versions of libraries.

#### Langchain

We saw a 48-point improvement for gpt-3.5 and a 58-point improvement for gpt-4. We hypothesize that the reason the "before" score for gpt-4 is lower is because it's better at mentioning what it doesn't know.

The drastic jump makes sense, given the entire Langchain documentation was built after gpt-4's knowledge cutoff.

#### Pydantic

We saw a 34-point improvement for gpt-3.5 and a 38-point improvement for gpt-4. This is because Pydantic v1 was launched before gpt-4's knowledge cutoff, but Pydantic v2 was launched in 2022. The improvement was not as sharp, but it was still significant.
