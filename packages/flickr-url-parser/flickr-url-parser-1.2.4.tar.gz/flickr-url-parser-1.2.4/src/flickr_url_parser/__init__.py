def parse_flickr_url(url: str) -> ParseResult:

    Parse a Flickr URL and return some key information, e.g. whether it's
    a single photo, an album, a user.

    The return value will be a dictionary with a key ``type`` and then some
    extra keys depending on the type, e.g.

        {"type": "single_photo", "photo_id": "50567413447"}

    Possible values for ``type``:

    -   ``single_photo``
            This will include a single extra key: ``photo_id``.

    -   ``album``
            This will include two extra keys: ``album_id`` and ``user_url``.
            Look up the latter with Flickr's ``flickr.urls.lookupUser`` API.

    -   ``user``
            This will include a single extra key: ``user_url``.
            Look up the latter with Flickr's ``flickr.urls.lookupUser`` API.

    -   ``group``
            This will include a single extra key: ``group_url``.
            Look it up with Flickr's ``flickr.urls.lookupGroup`` API.

    -   ``gallery``
            This will include a single extra key: ``gallery_id``.

    -   ``tag``
            This will include a single extra key: ``tag``.

    If you pass a URL which isn't a Flickr URL, or a Flickr URL which
    isn't recognised, then the function will throw ``NotAFlickrUrl``
    or ``UnrecognisedUrl`` exceptions.
