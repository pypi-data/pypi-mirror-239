        | and provide you the space and structure to be more creative, strategic
        | and focused.

        | Use an in-tray, notepad, digital list or voice recorder to capture
        | everything that has your attention.
        br
        | Little, big, personal and professional — all your to-do's, projects,
        | things to handle or finish.

        | Take everything that you capture and ask; is it actionable?
        br
        | If no, then trash it, incubate it, or file it as reference.
        br
        | If yes, decide the very next action required. If it will take less
        | than two minutes, do it now. If not, delegate it if you can; or put
        | it on a list to do when you can.

        | Put action reminders on the right lists. For example, create lists for
        | the apropriate categories — calls to make, errands to run, emails to send, etc.

        span.ml-2 Reflect — review frequently
      p
        | Look over your lists as often as necessary to trust your choices about
        | what to do next. Do a weekly review to get clear, get current and creative.
