# hexapixl

`hexapixl` is a Python command-line utility that allows you to encode and decode PNG images to and from hexadecimal data in a text file. This can be useful for various purposes, such as embedding images in text-based formats or sharing images as text data.

## Features

- **Encoding**: Convert a PNG image into its hexadecimal representation and save it to a text file.

- **Decoding**: Retrieve a PNG image from a text file containing hexadecimal data and save it as an image file.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed in your Python environment:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (these should be pre-installed with Python):
  - `binascii`
  - `argparse`

## Usage

### Encoding an Image to Hexadecimal

To encode a PNG image into hexadecimal format and save it to a text file, use the following command:

```bash
python hexapixl.py input_image.png -o output.txt
```
- input_image.png: The path to the input PNG image.
- -o output.txt: The output text file where the hexadecimal data will be saved.

Decoding Hexadecimal to an Image

To decode a text file containing hexadecimal data and save it as a PNG image, use the following command:

```bash
python hexapixl.py -d input.txt -o output_image.png
```
This command will read the hexadecimal data from "input.txt" and save it as a PNG image named "output_image.png."
