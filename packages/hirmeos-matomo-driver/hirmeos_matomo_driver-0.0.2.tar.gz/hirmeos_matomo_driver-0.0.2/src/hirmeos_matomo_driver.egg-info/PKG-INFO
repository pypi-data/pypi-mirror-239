=============
MATOMO Driver
=============

This driver allows programmatic retrieval and normalisation of Matomo usage
data, obtained via the Matomo API.

The driver code covers the following scenarios:
  * Number of visits to pages on the target website.
  * Number of downloads from different pages on the target website.
  * Number of events, by category, if these have been set up in matomo.

Documentation about querying the matomo api can be found here:
https://developer.matomo.org/api-reference/reporting-api
