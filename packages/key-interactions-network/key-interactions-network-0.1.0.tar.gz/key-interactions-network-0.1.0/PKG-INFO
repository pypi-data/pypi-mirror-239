This repository contains the work done for the publication titled:
"Key Interaction Networks: Identifying Evolutionarily Conserved Non-Covalent
Interaction Networks Across Protein Families".

In this work, we studied the non-covalent interaction networks of all unique
class A beta-lactamases structures to identify a network of evolutionarily
conserved interactions present throughout the family.
