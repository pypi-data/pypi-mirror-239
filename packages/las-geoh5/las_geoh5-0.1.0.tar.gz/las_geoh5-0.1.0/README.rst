las-geoh5
=========

Import/Export LAS files to/from geoh5 format.

This package contains three modules for import/export of LAS files in
and out of a geoh5 file. the import/export directories modules allow
export and subsequent re-import of LAS files from a drillhole group
saved in a geoh5 file to a structured set of directories on disk. The
import files module is intended for the more general case of LAS file
import to an existing drillhole group.

Basic Usage
-----------
.. _Geoscience ANALYST Pro: https://mirageoscience.com/mining-industry-software/geoscience-analyst-pro/

The most convenient way to use this package is through `Geoscience ANALYST Pro`_
where the import files driver may be run from the **file -> import**
menu.

All drivers may also be run from a ui.json file in `Geoscience ANALYST Pro`_
by either adding to the Python Scripts directory or drag and drop into
the viewport. Defaulted ui.json files can be found in the uijson folder
of the las-geoh5 project.

Finally, the drivers can be run from CLI using the following

.. code:: bash

   python -m las_geoh5.module.driver some_file.ui.json

Where module is one of ``import_files``, ``export_files``, or ``import_las``.
