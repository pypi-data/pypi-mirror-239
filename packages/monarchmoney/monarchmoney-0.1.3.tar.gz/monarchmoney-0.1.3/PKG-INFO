Description: # Monarch Money
        
        Python library for accessing [Monarch Money](https://www.monarchmoney.com/referral/ngam2i643l) data.
        
        # Installation
        
        ## From Source Code
        
        Clone this repository from Git
        
        `git clone https://github.com/hammem/monarchmoney.git`
        
        ## Via `pip`
        
        `pip install monarchmoney`
        # Instantiate & Login
        
        There are two ways to use this library: interactive and non-interactive.
        
        ## Interactive
        
        If you're using this library in something like iPython or Jupyter, you can run an interactive-login which supports multi-factor authentication:
        
        ```python
        mm = MonarchMoney()
        await mm.interactive_login()
        ```
        This will prompt you for the email, password and, if needed, the multi-factor token.
        
        ## Non-interactive
        
        For a non-interactive session, you'll need to create an instance and login:
        
        ```python
        mm = MonarchMoney()
        mm.login(email, password)
        ```
        
        This may throw a `RequireMFAException`.  If it does, you'll need to get a multi-factor token and call the following method:
        
        ```python
        mm.multi_factor_authenticate(email, password, multi_factor_code)
        ```
        
        # Accessing Data
        
        As of writing this README, the following methods are supported:
        
        - `get_accounts` - all the accounts linked to Monarch Money
        - `get_account_holdings` - all of the securities in a brokerage or similar type of account
        - `get_subscription_details` - the Monarch Money account's status (e.g. paid or trial)
        - `get_transactions` - transaction data, defaults to returning the last 100 transactions; can also be searched by date range
        - `get_transaction_categories` all of the categories configured in the account
        - `get_transaction_tags` - all of the tags configured in the account
