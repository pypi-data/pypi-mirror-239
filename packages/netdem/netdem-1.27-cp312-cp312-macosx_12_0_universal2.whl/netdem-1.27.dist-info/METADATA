# NetDEM

## Welcome

[**NetDEM**](https://apaam.github.io/netdem_docs/) is a C++ program library targeted at the computational mechanics of irregular granular materials and utilizing machine learning tools to boost the computational effciency.

It is currently capable of performing basic and general DEM simulations, with following features:

- Sphere and triangle facets contact solver
- GJK contact solver for convex particles
- SDF contact solver for arbitrary (convex and concave) particles
- Hybrid OpenMP and MPI parallel computing
- Integrated [mlpack](https://www.mlpack.org/) machine learning environment

The supported particle shapes include ``sphere``, ``cylinder``, ``poly-super-ellipsoid``, ``poly-super-quadrics``, ``spherical harmonics``, ``triangle mesh``, ``level set``, etc.

## Get started

Please kindly refer to [**NetDEM**](https://apaam.github.io/netdem_docs/) for usage, documentation, and code doxygen (python APIs) of the package.

Please kindly node that not all of the c++ properties or methods have been exposed to python. Please contact us (lai.zhengshou@outlook.com) if you would like to contribute.
