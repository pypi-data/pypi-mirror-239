# Neura Swift

Neura Swift extends the swift-sim library from the roboticstoolbox-python project fixes a few bugs

Swift provides:

  * visualisation of mesh objects (Collada and STL files) and primitive shapes;
  * robot visualisation and simulation;
  * recording and saving a video of the simulation;
  * source code which can be read for learning and teaching;

## Installing
### Using pip

Swift is designed to be controlled through the [Robotics Toolbox for Python](https://github.com/petercorke/robotics-toolbox-python). By installing the toolbox through PyPI, swift is installed as a dependency

```shell script
pip3 install neura-roboticstoolbox
```

Otherwise, Swift can be install by

```shell script
pip3 install neura-swift
```
