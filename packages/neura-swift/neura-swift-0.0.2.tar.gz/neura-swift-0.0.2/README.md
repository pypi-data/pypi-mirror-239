# Neura - Swift

## Installing
### Using pip

Swift is designed to be controlled through the [Robotics Toolbox for Python](https://github.com/petercorke/robotics-toolbox-python). By installing the toolbox through PyPI, swift is installed as a dependency.

Neura-Swift is an extension to work with the neura-roboticstoolbox.

```shell script
pip3 install neura-roboticstoolbox
```

Otherwise, Swift can be install by

```shell script
pip3 install neura-swift
```
