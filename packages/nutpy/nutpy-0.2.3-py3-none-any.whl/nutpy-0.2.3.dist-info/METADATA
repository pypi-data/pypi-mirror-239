Description
===========

nutpy is a set of tools to study how space-telescopes with spin-precession scan strategies observe the sky. It has been developed by students from the Technical University from Madrid (Spain).


Installation
============

Please check the [Installation Guide](https://gitlab.com/phd-jb/nutpy/nutpy/-/wikis/Installation-guide) in the project [wiki](https://gitlab.com/phd-jb/nutpy/nutpy/-/wikis/home).



Documentation
=============

Basic documentation can be found [here](https://nutpy.readthedocs.io/) and some examples can also be found in [binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gl/phd-jb%2Fnutpy%2Fnutapp/HEAD).


Contributing
=============

If you are interested in contributing to nutpy in someway, just contact me! You can find my email at the top and bottom of this readme.


Problems
========
