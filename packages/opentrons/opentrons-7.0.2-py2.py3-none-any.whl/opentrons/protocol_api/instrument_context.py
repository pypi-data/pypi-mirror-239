        The tip to pick up can be manually specified with the `location`
        argument. The `location` argument can be specified in several ways:

        * If the only thing to specify is which well from which to pick
          up a tip, `location` can be a :py:class:`.Well`. For instance,
          if you have a tip rack in a variable called `tiprack`, you can
          pick up a specific tip from it with
          ``instr.pick_up_tip(tiprack.wells()[0])``. This style of call can
          be used to make the robot pick up a tip from a tip rack that
          was not specified when creating the :py:class:`.InstrumentContext`.

        * If you want to pick up the next available tip(s) in a specific
          tip rack, you may use the tip rack directly:
          e.g. ``instr.pick_up_tip(tiprack)``

        * If the position to move to in the well needs to be specified,
          for instance to tell the robot to run its pick up tip routine
          starting closer to or farther from the top of the tip,
          `location` can be a :py:class:`.types.Location`; for instance,
          you can call ``instr.pick_up_tip(tiprack.wells()[0].top())``.

        :param location: The location from which to pick up a tip.
        :type location: :py:class:`.types.Location` or :py:class:`.Well` to

                        not picking it up--generally not desirable, but could
                        be used for dry-run).

        Drop the current tip.

        If no location is passed, the Pipette will drop the tip into its
        :py:attr:`trash_container`, which if not specified defaults to
        the fixed trash in slot 12.  From API version 2.15 on, if the trash container is
        the default fixed trash in A3 (slot 12), the API will default to
        dropping tips in different points within the trash container
        in order to prevent tips from piling up in a single location in the trash.

        The location in which to drop the tip can be manually specified with
        the `location` argument. The `location` argument can be specified in
        several ways:

            - If the only thing to specify is which well into which to drop
              a tip, `location` can be a :py:class:`.Well`. For instance,
              if you have a tip rack in a variable called `tiprack`, you can
              drop a tip into a specific well on that tiprack with the call
              `instr.drop_tip(tiprack.wells()[0])`. This style of call can
              be used to make the robot drop a tip into arbitrary labware.
            - If the position to drop the tip from as well as the
              :py:class:`.Well` to drop the tip into needs to be specified,
              for instance to tell the robot to drop a tip from an unusually
              large height above the tiprack, `location`
              can be a :py:class:`.types.Location`; for instance, you can call
              `instr.drop_tip(tiprack.wells()[0].top())`.

        :param location:
            The location to drop the tip
        :type location:
            :py:class:`.types.Location` or :py:class:`.Well` or None
        :param home_after:
            Whether to home this pipette's plunger after dropping the tip.
            If not specified, defaults to ``True`` on an OT-2.

            Setting ``home_after=False`` saves waiting a couple of seconds
            after the pipette drops the tip, but risks causing other problems.

            .. warning::
                Only set ``home_after=False`` if:

                * You're using a GEN2 pipette, not a GEN1 pipette.
                * You've tested ``home_after=False`` extensively with your
                  particular pipette and your particular tips.
                * You understand the risks described below.

            The ejector shroud that pops the tip off the end of the pipette is
            driven by the plunger's stepper motor. Sometimes, the strain of
            ejecting the tip can make that motor *skip* and fall out of sync
            with where the robot thinks it is.

            Homing the plunger fixes this, so, to be safe, we normally do it
            after every tip drop.

            If you set ``home_after=False`` to disable homing the plunger, and
            the motor happens to skip, you might see problems like these until
            the next time the plunger is homed:

            * The run might halt with a "hard limit" error message.
            * The pipette might aspirate or dispense the wrong volumes.
            * The pipette might not fully drop subsequent tips.

            GEN1 pipettes are especially vulnerable to this skipping, so you
            should never set ``home_after=False`` with a GEN1 pipette.

            Even on GEN2 pipettes, the motor can still skip. So, always
            extensively test ``home_after=False`` with your particular pipette
            and your particular tips before relying on it.

            * *new_tip* (``string``) --

                - 'never': no tips will be picked up or dropped during transfer
                - 'once': (default) a single tip will be used for all commands.
                - 'always': use a new tip for each transfer.

            * *trash* (``boolean``) --
              If `True` (default behavior), tips will be
              dropped in the trash container attached this `Pipette`.
              If `False` tips will be returned to tiprack.

            * *touch_tip* (``boolean``) --
              If `True`, a :py:meth:`touch_tip` will occur following each
              :py:meth:`aspirate` and :py:meth:`dispense`. If set to `False`
              (default behavior), no :py:meth:`touch_tip` will occur.

            * *blow_out* (``boolean``) --
              If `True`, a :py:meth:`blow_out` will occur following each
              :py:meth:`dispense`, but only if the pipette has no liquid left
              in it. If set to `False` (default), no :py:meth:`blow_out` will
              occur.

            * *blowout_location* (``string``) --
                - 'source well': blowout excess liquid into source well
                - 'destination well': blowout excess liquid into destination
                   well
                - 'trash': blowout excess liquid into the trash

                If no ``blowout_location`` specified, no ``disposal_volume``
                specified, and the pipette contains liquid,
                a :py:meth:`blow_out` will occur into the source well.

                If no ``blowout_location`` specified and either
                ``disposal_volume`` is specified or the pipette is empty,
                a :py:meth:`blow_out` will occur into the trash.

                If ``blow_out`` is set to ``False``, this parameter will be ignored.

            * *mix_before* (``tuple``) --
              The tuple, if specified, gives the amount of volume to
              :py:meth:`mix` preceding each :py:meth:`aspirate` during the
              transfer. The tuple is interpreted as (repetitions, volume).

            * *mix_after* (``tuple``) --
              The tuple, if specified, gives the amount of volume to
              :py:meth:`mix` after each :py:meth:`dispense` during the
              transfer. The tuple is interpreted as (repetitions, volume).

            * *disposal_volume* (``float``) --
              (:py:meth:`distribute` only) Volume of liquid to be disposed off
              after distributing. When dispensing multiple times from the same
              tip, it is recommended to aspirate an extra amount of liquid to
              be disposed off after distributing.

            * *carryover* (``boolean``) --
              If `True` (default), any `volume` that exceeds the maximum volume
              of this Pipette will be split into multiple smaller volumes.

            * *gradient* (``lambda``) --
              Function for calculating the curve used for gradient volumes.
              When `volume` is a tuple of length 2, its values are used to
              create a list of gradient volumes. The default curve for this
              gradient is linear (lambda x: x), however a method can be passed
              with the `gradient` keyword argument to create a custom curve.
