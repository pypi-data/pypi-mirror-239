### Installation

```bash
pip install pg-streamline
```

## Features

### Producer

- Handles PostgreSQL logical replication.
- Supports multiple output plugins like 'pgoutput' and 'wal2json'.
- Pooling support for better performance.

For more details, see the [Producer README](./pg_streamline/producer/README.md).

### Consumer

- Consumes and processes the events replicated by the producer.
- Extensible: Can be extended to perform custom actions when specific database changes occur.

For more details, see the [Consumer README](./pg_streamline/consumer/README.md).

### Parser

- Parses different types of logical events from PostgreSQL.
- Supports parsing of INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE events.
- Makes it easier to understand and act upon the changes in the database.

For more details, see the [Parser README](./pg_streamline/parser/README.md).

### Plugins

- Extend the functionality of pgStreamline with various plugins.
- Currently supports RabbitMQ for message queuing.
- More plugins are in development.

For more details, see the [Plugins README](./pg_streamline/plugins/README.md).
