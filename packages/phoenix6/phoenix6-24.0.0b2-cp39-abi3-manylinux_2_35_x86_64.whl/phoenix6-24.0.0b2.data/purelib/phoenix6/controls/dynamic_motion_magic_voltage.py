        Requires Phoenix Pro and CANivore;
        Requests Motion Magic® to target a final
        position using a motion profile.  This dynamic request allows runtime changes to

        Motion Magic® produces a motion profile in real-time while attempting to honor
        the specified Cruise Velocity, Acceleration, and Jerk value.  Target position
        can be changed on-the-fly and Motion Magic® will do its best to adjust the
        profile.  This control mode is voltage-based, so relevant closed-loop gains will
        use Volts for the numerator.
