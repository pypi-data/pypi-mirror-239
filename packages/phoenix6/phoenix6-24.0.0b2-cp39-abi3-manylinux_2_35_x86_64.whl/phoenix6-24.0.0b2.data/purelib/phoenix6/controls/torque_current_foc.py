        Requires Phoenix Pro;
        Request a specified motor current (field oriented
        control).
        |
        This control request will drive the motor to the requested motor (stator)
        current value.  This leverages field oriented control (FOC), which means greater
        peak power than what is documented.  This scales to torque based on Motor's kT
        constant.
        
        :param output:    Amount of motor current in Amperes
        :type output: float
        :param max_abs_duty_cycle:    The maximum absolute motor output that can be
                                      applied, which effectively limits the velocity.
                                      For example, 0.50 means no more than 50% output in
                                      either direction.  This is useful for preventing
                                      the motor from spinning to its terminal velocity
                                      when there is no external torque applied unto the
                                      rotor.  Note this is absolute maximum, so the
                                      value should be between zero and one.
        :type max_abs_duty_cycle: float
        :param deadband:    Deadband in Amperes.  If torque request is within deadband,
                            the bridge output is neutral. If deadband is set to zero
                            then there is effectively no deadband. Note if deadband is
                            zero, a free spinning motor will spin for quite a while as
                            the firmware attempts to hold the motor's bemf. If user
                            expects motor to cease spinning quickly with a demand of
                            zero, we recommend a deadband of one Ampere. This value will
                            be converted to an integral value of amps.

                                              is zero (or within deadband).  Set to
                                              false to use the NeutralMode configuration
                                              setting (default). This flag exists to

                                              control when output is zero, which is to
