        True if we should factory default newer unsupported configs,
        false to leave newer unsupported configs alone.

        This flag addresses a corner case where the device may have
        firmware with newer configs that didn't exist when this
        version of the API was built. If this occurs and this
        flag is true, unsupported new configs will be factory
        defaulted to avoid unexpected behavior.

        This is also the behavior in Phoenix 5, so this flag
        is defaulted to true to match.

        robot's reference.

        Pigeon2 allows the user to trim the gyroscope's sensitivity. While
        this isn't necessary for the Pigeon2, as it comes calibrated
        out-of-the-box, users can make use of this to make the Pigeon2 even
        more accurate for their application.
