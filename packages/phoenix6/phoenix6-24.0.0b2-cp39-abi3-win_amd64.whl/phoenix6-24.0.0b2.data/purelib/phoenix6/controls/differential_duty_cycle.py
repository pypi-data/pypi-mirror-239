        Request a specified motor duty cycle with a differential position closed-loop.
        |
        This control mode will output a proportion of the supplied voltage which is
        supplied by the user. It will also set the motor's differential position
        setpoint to the specified position.
        
        :param target_output:    Proportion of supply voltage to apply in fractional
                                 units between -1 and +1
        :type target_output: float

        :type differential_position: float
        :param enable_foc:    Set to true to use FOC commutation (requires Phoenix Pro),
                              which increases peak power by ~15%. Set to false to use
                              trapezoidal commutation.  FOC improves motor performance
                              by leveraging torque (current) control.  However, this may
                              be inconvenient for applications that require specifying
                              duty cycle or voltage.  CTR-Electronics has developed a
                              hybrid method that combines the performances gains of FOC
                              while still allowing applications to provide duty cycle or
                              voltage demand.  This not to be confused with simple
                              sinusoidal control or phase voltage control which lacks
                              the performance gains.

                                     configuration api to set the gain values for the

                                              output is zero (or within deadband).  Set
                                              to false to use the NeutralMode
                                              configuration setting (default). This flag
                                              exists to provide the fundamental behavior
                                              of this control when output is zero, which
