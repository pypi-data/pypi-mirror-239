        Request PID to target velocity with voltage feedforward.
        |
        This control mode will set the motor's velocity setpoint to the velocity
        specified by the user. In addition, it will apply an additional voltage as an
        arbitrary feedforward value.
        
        :param velocity:    Velocity to drive toward in rotations per second.
        :type velocity: float
        :param acceleration:    Acceleration to drive toward in rotations per second
                                squared. This is typically used for motion profiles
                                generated by the robot program.
        :type acceleration: float
        :param enable_foc:    Set to true to use FOC commutation (requires Phoenix Pro),
                              which increases peak power by ~15%. Set to false to use
                              trapezoidal commutation.  FOC improves motor performance
                              by leveraging torque (current) control.  However, this may
                              be inconvenient for applications that require specifying
                              duty cycle or voltage.  CTR-Electronics has developed a
                              hybrid method that combines the performances gains of FOC
                              while still allowing applications to provide duty cycle or
                              voltage demand.  This not to be confused with simple
                              sinusoidal control or phase voltage control which lacks
                              the performance gains.

                        before enabling this feature. Slot must be within [0,2].

                                              output is zero (or within deadband).  Set
                                              to false to use the NeutralMode
                                              configuration setting (default). This flag
                                              exists to provide the fundamental behavior
                                              of this control when output is zero, which
                                              is to provide 0V to the motor.
