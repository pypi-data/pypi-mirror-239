        Optimizes the device's bus utilization by reducing the
        update frequencies of its status signals.

        All status signals that have not been explicitly gven an
        update frequency will be disabled. Note that if other
        status signals in the same frame have been given an update
        frequency, the update frequency will be honored for the
        entire frame.

        This function only needs to be called once on this device
        in the robot program. Additionally, this method does not
        necessarily need to be called after setting the update
        frequencies of other signals.

        To restore the default status update frequencies, remove
        this method call, redeploy the robot application, and
        power-cycle the devices on the bus. Alternatively, the user
        can override individual status update frequencies using
        setUpdateFrequency.
