## Description
- `classical.py`, collection of formulas from Cinematics and Dynamics fields;
- `constants.py`, collection of constants from all fields;
- `electromagnetism.py`, collection of formulas from Electromagnetism field;
- `fluids.py`, collection of formulas from Fluids field;
- `gravity.py`, collection of formulas from Gravitation field;
- `mathem.py`, collection of utility math formulas;
- `relativity.py`, collection of formulas from Relativity field;
- `thermodynamics.py`, collection of formulas from Thermodynamics field;


## How to use it
```python
import physics
from physics import classical  #importing the classical module
print(classical.force(3,4))    #using a function from the classical module
```
### Result
```
>>> (12, 'N') // Respectevely, the result and the measurement unit
```
