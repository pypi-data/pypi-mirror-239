## 0.2.0 - 2023-11-07

This is the prototype release of Protokolo. It contains the most basic
functionality and limited documentation, but is a minimum viable product. You
can:

- Compile the `changelog.d` directory into a CHANGELOG file with
  `protokolo compile`.
- Create the `changelog.d` directory with `protokolo init`.
- Configure some bits and bobs in `.protokolo.toml` files.
- Use both Markdown and reStructuredText.

## 0.1.0 - 2023-10-20

This release doesn't contain much of anything. I made it to claim the namespace
on PyPI.
