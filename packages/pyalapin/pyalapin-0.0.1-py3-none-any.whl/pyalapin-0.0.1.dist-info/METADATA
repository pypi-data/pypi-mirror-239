## PyAlapin, your customized chess engine
Is it the best, most efficient and state of the art chess engine ? I'm pretty sure not.

However, driven by passion and madness, I have developed my own chess game in Python.
For your pretty eyes and your devilish smile, I share it with you. But only with you.

Special thanks and dedication to LeMerluche, crushing its opponents on chess.com with alapin openings ❤️

## How to play with interface
```python
from pyalapin.interface import ChessApp

if __name__ == '__main__':
    ChessApp(
        play_with_ai=False # Set to True if you want to play agains AI
    ).run()

```

## How to play with Python commands

<img align="right" src="docs/scholars_mate_command.gif">

```python
from pyalapin.engine import ChessGame

game = ChessGame(
    automatic_draw=True, # Set to True if you want
                         # to have each turn drawn in terminal
    ai=False, # set to True if you want to play agains AI
    save_pgn=False # set to True if you want to
                   # save moves as PGN
)
game.move_from_coordinates(game.player1, 1, 4, 3, 4)
game.move_from_coordinates(game.player2, 6, 4, 4, 4)
game.move_from_coordinates(game.player1, 0, 5, 3, 2)
game.move_from_coordinates(game.player2, 6, 3, 5, 4)
game.move_from_coordinates(game.player1, 0, 3, 2, 5)
game.move_from_coordinates(game.player2, 6, 2, 4, 2)
game.move_from_coordinates(game.player2, 2, 5, 6, 5)
```
There are colors in the command line not showing here in the GIF, though...
