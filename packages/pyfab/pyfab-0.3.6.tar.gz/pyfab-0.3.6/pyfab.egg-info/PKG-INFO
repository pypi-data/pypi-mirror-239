PYFAB - Python interface to the Fabber Bayesian model fitting tool
==================================================================

Fabber is a Bayesian model-fitting framework designed to fit nonlinear
parameterised models to timeseries data, particularly 4D fMRI data
such as ASL, CEST, DCE, DSC, etc.

PYFAB offers a Python interface to the tool which can work with
the command line Fabber tool, or the shared library version, 
depending on which is installed.

Fabber must be installed before use - See https://fabber_core.readthedocs.io/.
Fabber and a selection of models will be available in the upcoming
FSL 6.0.1 release
