## Redco: A Lightweight Tool to Automate Distributed Training

Redco is a lightweight and user-friendly tool designed to automate distributed training and inference for large models while simplifying the ML pipeline development process without necessitating MLSys expertise from users.

* Redco allows for the simple implementation of distributed training and inference, eliminating the need for additional coding efforts or complex configurations, but still exhibits efficiency comparable to the most advanced model parallel tools.
* Redco enables customization of arbitrary ML pipelines within three functions, eliminating repetitive ans boilerplate coding, such as multi-host related processing, etc. We demonstrate that this mechanism is widely applicable to various ML algorithms

### Features

* **Lightweight concepts**: *Redco* only introduces three concepts: Deployer, Trainer, and Predictor. You can be an expert in a couple of minites!
* **Easy-to-use**: Customize your pipeline with a couple of functions, each with a handful of lines. Designing your pipeline is the only thing you need to take care with *redco*.
* **Automatic deployment**: No need to take care of your multi-host or multi-device environment. *Redco* processes your environment automatically, as well as other pipeline-unrelated things, e.g., randomness, logging, etc.
* **Automatic model/data parallelism**: No need to concern your large models and large datasets. *Redco* distributes your models and datasets to all your devices automatically. 
* **No need to know JAX**: *Redco* only needs a couple of numpy-like functions as your pipeline design. 

### Installation

#### Install Jax
```
pip install --upgrade jax[cuda11_pip]==0.4.13 -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
```
Jax version (`==0.4.13`) can be flexible, as long as it matches your CUDA/CUDNN version.

If you are using TPU/CPU/AMD/Apple, see [here](https://github.com/google/jax#installation) for corresponding installation commands.

#### Install Redco
```
pip install redco
```
