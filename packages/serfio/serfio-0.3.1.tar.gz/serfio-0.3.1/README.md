# Serfio: Python client for Serf

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

`serfio` is a Python `asyncio` client for [Serf](https://www.serf.io/). The goal was to create client with zero or minimal dependencies. It allows to use it with Debian 12 (Bookworm) without installing any additional packages, besides `python3` and `python3-msgpack`. As far as I know, this eliminates licensing and security concerns, relieving my headaches.

`serfio` implements all Serf RPC commands. It includes `streams` implemented as async iterators (everything is implemented as an async iterator üßê). That was another goal: to make easy to use interface. At this stage of development is very straightforward and simple, and might not change in future.

`serfio` is *under development*, it is not yet tested in production. It was tested with Serf 0.8.2. For more mature client see [alternatives](#alternatives).
