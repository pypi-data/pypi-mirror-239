        Transliterate the input text using the rule-based approach and apply suggestions from the FastText model.

        This method takes Singlish text as input, transliterates it into the Sinhala script using the rule-based approach,
        and then applies word suggestions from the FastText model to enhance the transliteration quality.

        The method first uses the rule-based transliteration approach to convert Singlish text into Sinhala script.
        Then, for each word, it retrieves the best suggestions from the FastText model and replaces the original word
        with the top suggestion if available.

        Parameters:
        -----------
        text : str
            The Singlish text to be transliterated.

        Returns:
        --------
        str
            The transliterated text in the Sinhala script with FastText-based suggestions applied.

        Example:
        ---------
        >>> from sinlingua.singlish.rulebased_transliterator import RuleBasedTransliterator
        >>>
        >>> model_path = "../../resources/models/cc.si.300.vec"
        >>> transliterator = MachineTransliterator(model=model_path)
        >>> input_phrase = "oyaata kohomada"
        >>>
        >>> out = transliterator.transliterator(text=input_phrase)
        >>> print(out)
        ඔයාට කොහොමද

        Notes:
        ------
        - The method combines the rule-based and machine learning approaches for better transliteration results.
        - Make sure the FastText model has been initialized and loaded before calling this method.
