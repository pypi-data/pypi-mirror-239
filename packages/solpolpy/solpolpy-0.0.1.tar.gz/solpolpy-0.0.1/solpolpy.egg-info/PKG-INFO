**UNDER DEVELOPMENT**

`solpolpy` is a solar polarization resolver based on [Deforest et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ac43b6).
It converts between various polarization formats, e.g. from the native three triple version from observations
(also known as the MZP convention) to polarization brightness (pB) and total polarization (B), Stokes I, Q and U, etc.
An example of transforming the polarization basis using the LASCO/C2 images is 
shown in the image below.
The images at polarizing angles of -60°, 0° and +60° is shown in the top panel as 
Bm, Bz and Bp respectively.
The bottom panel shows the output of the `solpolpy` to convert the initial basis 
to the Stokes I, Q and U.

## Origin of the Name
`solpolpy` is just a combination of `sol` for solar, `pol` for polarization, and `py` for Python.
