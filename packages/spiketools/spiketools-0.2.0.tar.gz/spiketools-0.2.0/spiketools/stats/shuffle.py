    - The shuffle function is then run, without the dropped range

    Notes
    -----
    This approach shuffles spikes by creating bins of varying length and then
    circularly shuffling within those bins.
    This should disturb the spike to spike structure in a dynamic way while also
    conserving structure uniformly across the distribution of lags.
    This function can be a little slow when running a lot.
    The main holdup is `np.roll` (unclear if / how to optimize).
    The next biggest hold up is converting the spike train to spike times.
    This shuffling process is very dependent on the `bin_width_range` argument.
    It is recommended that `bin_width_range[1] > 3`, and that the difference
    between the two values of `bin_width_range` is at least 1.

    --------
    Shuffle spike times using the circular bin method:

    >>> from spiketools.sim.times import sim_spiketimes

    Notes
    -----
    This approach creates "shuffles" by simulating new spike trains from a Poisson distribution.

    Note that this approach is therefore not strictly a "shuffle" in the sense that the outputs
    are not literally 'shuffled' versions of the input, and are instead new / simulated set of spikes
    sampled based on the statistics of the input.

    In addition, since this approach simulates new spike trains based on an average rate, different
    iterations of the shuffles are not guaranteed to have the same number of spikes (and are not
    guaranteed to have the same number of spikes as the input). This is why the outputs are returned
    are a list of shuffles.

    Examples
    --------
    Shuffle spike times using the Poisson method:

    >>> from spiketools.sim.times import sim_spiketimes
