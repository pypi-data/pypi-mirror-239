# Introduction

This package enables target-agnostic layout operations using CSS Grid and Flexbox. Possible uses include UI layouts, page layouts for reports, complex plotting layouts, etc.

It implements Python bindings for [Taffy](https://github.com/dioxuslabs/taffy), an implementation of Grid/Flexbox written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). It was originally based on [Stretch](https://vislyhq.github.io/stretch/) (hence the name), but has since migrated to use Taffy.

## Getting Started

Helpful resources to getting started with layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox are listed below.

### Flexbox

## Usage

See [demos](https://github.com/mortencombat/stretchable/tree/main/demos) for examples of basic usage. Keep in mind that the current version of Stretchable is early stage and the API can be expected to change (eg. improve).

## Building

Install Rust with [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) and use `maturin develop` for development and `maturin build [--release]` to build.

## Testing

Install test dependencies and invoke `pytest`. Note that there are more than 700 tests, the majority of which are run using Selenium with the Chrome WebDriver, and the complete test suite can take 10+ minutes to complete. Use `pytest --lf` to only run the last-failed tests.
