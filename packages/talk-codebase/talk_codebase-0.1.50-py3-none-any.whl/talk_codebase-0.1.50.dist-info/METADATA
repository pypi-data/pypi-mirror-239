# talk-codebase

[![Node.js Package](https://github.com/rsaryev/talk-codebase/actions/workflows/python-publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rsaryev/talk-codebase/actions/workflows/python-publish.yml)

Talk-codebase is a tool that allows you to converse with your codebase using Large Language Models (LLMs) to answer your
queries. It supports offline code processing using LlamaCpp and [GPT4All](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all) without
sharing your code with third parties, or you can use OpenAI if privacy is not a concern for you. Please note that
talk-codebase is still under development and is recommended for educational purposes, not for production use.

## Installation

Requirement Python 3.8.1 or higher
Your project must be in a git repository

```bash
pip install talk-codebase
```

After installation, you can use it to chat with your codebase in the current directory by running the following command:

```bash
talk-codebase chat <path>
```

Select model type: Local or OpenAI

OpenAI

If you use the OpenAI model, you need an OpenAI API key. You can get it from [here](https://beta.openai.com/). Then you
will be offered a choice of available models.
