# Project Overview

## Variational Quantum Linear Solver

VQLS is a variational approach to solving linear system of equations. The method was originally proposed in [1]. The vqls-prototype facilitate the use of VQLS for any applications requiring solivng linear systems on simulators or real backends. 

## Solution Explanation

In addition to the original reference the qiskit textbook contains a very clear and concise explanation of the VQLS algorithm [2]. We refer readers to this excellent material for further discussion
