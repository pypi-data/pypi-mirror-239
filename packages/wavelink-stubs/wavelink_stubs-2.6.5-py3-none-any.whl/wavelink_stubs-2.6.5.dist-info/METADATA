This package contains type stubs to provide more precise static types and type inference for [wavelink 2](https://github.com/PythonistaGuild/Wavelink). wavelink 3 doesn't need these stubs since it is fully type-annotated.

## Installation

```shell
pip install wavelink-stubs
```

## Version number scheme
The major and minor version of `wavelink-stubs` will roughly match the major and minor version numbers of the `wavelink` release the stubs represent.

## Acknowledgements
Thank you to:
- Maintainers of `wavelink` for the wonderful library.
- Bryan Forbes for providing a great reference with his [`asyncpg-stubs`](https://github.com/bryanforbes/asyncpg-stubs) library.
